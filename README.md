My google extension ive made to get colors from other websites (rgba and hex), its not so professional, but it works haha.

How to Install?

In Chrome, go to the three dots in the top right side, click and go to Extensions > Manage Extensions

In the "Manage Extensions" page, activate Developer Mode, and then click "Load unpacked", now you select the "Xtension" folder and press "select folder" (or something like that).

now you activate it and voil√†, the Xtension works!
